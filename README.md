# ADAL Android Microsoft Graph API Sample 

**There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the Microsoft identity platform** (formerly Azure AD v2.0)

Check it out: https://github.com/azure-samples/ms-identity-android-native

If you really need to access this Azure AD v1.0, you can navigate to the [master](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-android/tree/master) branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
